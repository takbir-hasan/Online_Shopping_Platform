# Online_Shopping_Platform

A sample of online shopping app.

A customer can place an order online. For each item, the order can be sent to the customer by courier or regular delivery depending upon their membership type. The customers can be premium users or free users. Only premium users will get the courier service. If the item is made up of glass, it is dispatched by a careful distributor instead of a regular one. Both users can pay by card or Bkash, where the system sends a confirmation message. Optionally, if the member selects the notification option in the order, the business will send a confirmation note to the user.
