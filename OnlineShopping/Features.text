A customer can place an order online. For each item, the order can be sent to the customer either by courier or by regular delivery depending upon their membership type. The customers can be premium users or free users. Only the premium users will get the courier service. If the item is made up of glass, then it is dispatched by a careful distributor instead of regular. Both the users can pay by card or bkash, where the system sends a confirmation message. Optionally, if the member selected the notification option in the order, the business will send a confirmation note to the user.
